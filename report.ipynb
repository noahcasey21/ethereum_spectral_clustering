    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of blockchain is an ever-evolving landscape, with a growing list of blockchain protocols, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets that are increasing in complexity. The uses of blockchain technology are beginning to provide significant societal benefits. There are discussions about utilizing blockchain for election integrity, cryptocurrencies being adopted in countries with unstable currencies, and blockchain technology offering a sense of control in an increasingly interconnected world. However, as with all technological advancements, there are drawbacks: scams, fraud, and untraceable criminal transactions tarnish the technology's reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solana is a popular blockchain protocol that prides itself on speed and environmental efficiency. The native cryptocurrency token of Solana is SOL, although other tokens can also be traded on the blockchain. Solana incorporates many features such as proof of stake, smart contracts, and web3. For the sake of relevance, we will focus on two primary features of blockchain: wallet addresses and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each blockchain has a native token that serves as the base currency for transactions. This can be compared to a national currency that can be exchanged for other currencies at an airport. In this analogy, the native token, SOL, is equivalent to the national currency, while other cryptocurrency tokens on the blockchain represent other currencies that can be traded according to the exchange rate. These tokens can be exchanged between wallets or with a liquidity pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallets on the Solana blockchain are text-based addresses used to send and receive cryptocurrency. Each address is unique, ensuring that cryptocurrency transfers occur only between the intended parties. While a single person may own multiple wallet addresses, transferring cryptocurrency between them requires transactions. Sometimes, transactions involve a liquidity pool, also known as an automated market maker (AMM). AMMs facilitate seamless transactions and provide some price stability by allowing wallets to deposit a token and receive a counter-token in return, similar to a bank deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed project is to cluster wallets and transactions to glean insight into different categories of transactions that occur on the blockchain as well as differentiating wallets. It is the current thought that this may reveal transaction networks between organizations or a group of individuals that primarily use cryptocurrency. This may give way to techniques in finding criminal networks that use cryptocurrency. We may also be able to identify wallets of market makers or institutions that heavily use cryptocurrency. A successful model will provide an appropriate number of clusters with reasonable separability that may be investigated further to discover relationships between the wallets and transactions in each cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use multiple approaches for our cluster analysis using a variety of initial transformations on the similarity matrix. We consider the weights to be the sum of the transactions from $i\\to j$ in SOL. The graph will be weakly directed, so only wallets that receive or send SOL will be considered. For each transformation type, we will run the model using spectral clustering by constructing the graph Laplacian matrix and using eigendecomposition. Because the eigenvectors are unlikely to be perfectly sepearable, we will use the $k$ largest eigenvectors, $v^1, v^2, ..., v^k$. We will then utilize $z^1=(v^1_1, v^2_1, ..., v^k_1), z^2=(v^1_2, v^2_2, ..., v^k_2),...,z^m=(v^1_m, v^2_m, ..., v^k_m)$ as the new data points for points $1,2,..., m$ and evaluate a variety of clustering algorithms, where we will use the Davies-Bouldin Index as our evaluation criteria. This index is the average ratio of the distances within the cluster to the distances between clusters. Thus, clusters that are further apart and less-dispersed will result in a lower, better score. For each transformation type, we will retain the clusters determined by the algorithm that leads to the lowest Davies-Bouldin Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will then compare the cluster results of each transformation to determine if any transformation works better, or if these transformation types may be used in conjunction to discover different communities in the Solana blockchain. We will use known addresses within the clusters to determine if there are any significant groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Davies-Bouldin Index, is defined by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$DB = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^kmax(\\frac{\\Delta X_i + \\Delta X_j}{\\delta (X_i, X_j)}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where $\\Delta X_k$ is the within cluster sum of squares and $\\delta (X_i, X_j)$ is the intercluster distance betweek clusters $X_i$ and $X_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use transformations to unipartiate weighted networks, which will maintain directionality of the network [3]. We will also use the naive graph transformation, which lacks the ability to retain directional information, as a control to test the effectiveness of more complicated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Graph Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most simple approach in a directed graph transform is to naively assume that if a transaction occurs between two parties, then there is a relationship. Thus, we will simply combine the weights from $i\\to j$ and $j\\to i$ to create a symmetric, weighted simliarity matrix. Given directed adjacency matrix $A$, we define \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_u = A + A^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as our new similarity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetrization Based on Random Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We define an adjacency matrix by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_u = \\frac{\\Pi P + P^T\\Pi}{2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is the transition matrix of the random walk and $\\Pi$ is the diagonal matrix with the probabilities of staying at each node in the stationary state. This transformation makes it easier to extract clusters that satisfy the criterion of low normalized cuts. That is, a group is well-connected with itself, but sparsely connected with the rest of the graph [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bibliometric Symmetrization\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A natural requirement for clustering is that a symmetrization approach should create edges between similar nodes even though in the original network they do not exist. This ensures that if a two wallets transact with one wallet, they are related. We consider $B = AA^T$ and $C = A^TA$ where the former contains information about common outgoing edges and the latter contains information about common incoming edges. Thus, we will use \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_u = B + C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as our new adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree-Discounted Symmetrization\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin with the weighted, directed adjacency matrix. This transformation, known as degree-discounted symmetrization, takes the power-law degree distribution into account. This distribution claims that there are a few nodes in the network with a very high degree compared to the rest of the network. Generally, this transformation looks to give a higher level of similarity to nodes with low cardinality. That is, if only five wallets sent cryptocurrency to wallet $x$, then these have higher similarity than five-hundred wallets sending cryptocurrency to wallet $y$. The transformation considers the in and out transactions. Let\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = D^{-0.5}_{out}AD^{-0.5}_{in}A^TD^{-0.5}_{out}\\\\\n",
    "C = D^{-0.5}_{in}A^TD^{-0.5}_{out}AD^{-0.5}_{in}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where $in$ refers to transactions into a wallet and $out$ refers to transactions coming out of a wallet. Thus, we have the similarity matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_u=B+C.$$\n",
